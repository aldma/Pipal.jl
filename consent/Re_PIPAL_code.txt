Yes, that would be fine. Thanks!

Dear Prof. Curtis,

thanks for your kind answer.

I'd tentatively put the MIT or MPL 2.0 license on my Julia translation but I want to be sure we agree on that.

Would you be fine with that?

Best regards,

Alberto

Hi Alberto,

This is absolutely fine with me.  I hope people find it useful!

And of course I'd be interested to hear about any success stories or other feedback that you hear about the algorithm.

Let's hope all goes well and the community will indeed get to meet in person at ICCOPT 2022 :-)

Best,

Dear Prof. Frank E. Curtis,

I am working with your software for PIPAL and I am writing what is
essentially a translation in the Julia language of your Matlab code,
based on PIPAL_1.2.zip from your website.

I’d like to distribute it, say on GitHub, so users can install and use
it easily. In particular, I am working with the tools provided by the
"JuliaSmoothOptimizers" ecosystem:

https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers

Since I didn't see any license with your code, I'd like your consent to
distribute the Julia version.

Hope all is well in Bethlehem. Looking forward to meeting you at ICCOPT
2022!

Best regards,

Alberto
